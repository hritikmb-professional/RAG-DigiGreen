 AI-Powered Regulatory Assistant for Industrial Environmental Compliance
1. Objective
 To develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based conversational assistant (chatbot) that helps industries navigate environmental protection laws and emission regulations relevant to their sector, waste type, and operational activity. The assistant will reduce ambiguity in compliance, mitigate legal risks, and improve transparency in industrial environmental governance.
2. Motivation
 Industries in India and worldwide are bound by a web of environmental regulations spanning acts like:
The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974


1.The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981


2.The Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986


3.The Hazardous Waste Management Rules, 2008, among others,etc...


However, compliance is often hindered by:
Poor accessibility to updated regulations
Ambiguous or overly legalistic language
Lack of industry-specific filtering


This project seeks to resolve these problems using AI-driven legal retrieval and summarization, allowing industries to query with natural language and receive reliable, context-backed answers.
